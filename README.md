# PyTorch-Image-Classifier
AI PyTorch Image Classifier by Remington Howden.


Created, trained, tested and validated an Image Classifier Neural Network with PyTorch. 
The "ipynb" file is a Jupyter Notebook file where the program can be ran within thee one environment on your machine locally. 
"train.py" & "predict.py" Python scripts have also been provided for Command Line Interface execution with options for modding the default parameters. This allows you to test the Deep Learning Neural Network on the dataset of your liking. 

Thank you for viewing my Artificial Intelligence project, now clone and have some fun with it!
